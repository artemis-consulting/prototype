Project Overview
================
Artemis Consulting kicked off our agile project named "FDA Drug Monitor" by assembling the project team and discussing the 18F opportunity/problem statement.

Team and Stakeholders
=====================
* Project leader (Product Owner) – Rohit G.
* Scrum master – Jim T.
* Backend developer – Risa O.
* Front end – Stephanie S.
* UX – Hoa P.
* Web design – David N.
* DevOps – Jay M.

The team decided on nominating Rohit as the project leader based on his qualifications and the technical product manager (TPM) role he performs on the Congress.gov contract. Under normal circumstances, 18F would be considered key stakeholders. However, due to the nature of this RFP, Artemis management is fulfilling this function with Rohit performing the role of ‘Product Owner’. 

His responsibilities include:

* Ensuring the service will meet the needs of its prospective users
* Ensuring that key features are built
* Managing the features and defect backlogs on a daily basis
* Setting priorities and providing the definition of "done" 
[Pool 2, requirement A, B and Play 6 ]

The team members assembled for this project are experts in their respective disciplines. [Pool 2, requirement A and Play 7 ]

User-Centered Design 
====================
During the story planning meetings, the following prospective users where identified:
* Public users
* Doctors 
* Pharmacists 
* Attorneys 
* FDA SMEs/employees 
* Federal regulators and watchdog agencies
* State regulators

The team strongly felt that applying the UCD techniques in the sections previously mentioned satisfy Play [1] and [2].

Mobile-first Responsive Design
------------------------------
Our HTML experts created multiple functioning web prototypes throughout the course of the development phase. These were used for Accessibility testing and usability testing. 

Formal Accessibility Review
---------------------------
Our team conducted a fairly formal accessibility review with the initial web prototype. The results of this review are [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype/blob/master/user-centered-design/3-user-interface/accessibility/FDA%20Drug%20Monitor%20Formal%20Accessibility%20Review.pdf).

Usability Testing
-----------------
Agile usability testing was integrated into the design and prototyping process so that the team could identify and fix user experience problems before they become baked in and expensive to address.

Agile Delivery Approach
=======================
For the FDA prototype, we decided on 2-day sprints but chose to add a 4-day sprint to accommodate the unusual nature of this project and weekend work after the project deadline was extended.

Results of usability testing can be viewed [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype/blob/master/SUPPORTING_DOC.md#section-pool2-ucd). 
For automated testing, we used the open source Selenium tool. The scripts for these tests are checked in [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype/blob/master/code/core/tests/test_behavior.py).

Continuous Monitoring
=====================

For this prototype, we installed CloudWatch and Threat Stack, two security-related monitoring services that are built for AWS. [Pool 2 requirements F, Play 9 and Play 12]

Configuration Management
========================

The team used Puppet for automated configuration management. Docker is used for container virtualization, a Docker container is available at 
[Pool 2 requirements G]

Automated testing and deployments
---------------------------------
For this prototype, we built a suite of automated tests, which tested the app as well as ensured wide code coverage (>92%). [Pool 2 requirements F, Play 10]
